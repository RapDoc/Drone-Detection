# 🚁 Drone Detection System using YOLOv8

A computer vision-based system that uses **YOLOv8** to detect drones in real time from a video feed. Built to assist in monitoring and securing areas from unauthorized drone activity using camera-only visual detection.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Detect drones in live video using object detection
- ✅ Highlight and track drones with bounding boxes
- ✅ Log drone sightings for further analysis

---

## 🧠 Features

- 📸 **YOLOv8 Drone Detection** — Real-time object detection using pretrained or custom YOLOv8 model
- 🔄 **Live Video Feed** — Uses OpenCV to capture and display detections
- 💾 **Event Logging** — Logs timestamped detections
- ⚡ **High Performance** — Optimized for low-latency drone detection
